				I am a Junior here at Millersvilles. I was born in Philadelphia. My strong suit, when it comes to design, is mostly print design. Coding is something I do struggle alot in, but it is something I want to get better since it is a important aspect of graphic design. My favorite aspect of design is mostly print work and building logo's, and motion design. Motion is my favorite because I wanted to be a traditional animator but this is the closest I get to it doing it, even though I don't know the program as a whole.
